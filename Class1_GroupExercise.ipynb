    "# Class 1 Group Exercise: Analyzing the Effects of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "The `ToothGrowth` dataset contains results from an experiment studying the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods: orange juice (OJ) or ascorbic acid (VC).\n",

    "## Your Task\n",
    "Working in groups, perform a comprehensive statistical analysis to answer: **Does delivery method affect tooth growth, and what sample size would we need for a follow-up study?**\n",
